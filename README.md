# Pixiv Powerful Viewer

This app allows you to locally view and search collection saved by
[Powerful Pixiv Downloader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/powerful-pixiv-downloader/dkndmhgdcmjdmkdonmbgjpijejdcilfh)
browser extension.

The app is build with _Tauri_ and uses _Rust_ on backend to load your collections faster.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is now put on halt as I'm experimenting with other solutions to make the app more performant.
> At the moment I develop _Go_ app that combines batch **downloader** and local **viewer** and gonna use GTK platform.

## Creating collection

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pixiv Powerful Viewer parses specific folder structure inside collections. Follow the steps below to configure
> [Powerful Pixiv Downloader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/powerful-pixiv-downloader/dkndmhgdcmjdmkdonmbgjpijejdcilfh)
> extension properly.

- You can use any folder structure as long as every work has _it's own folder with metadata file and all the assets directly in it_
- If metadata file wasn't found, program assumes folder name to be _the title of the work_ and its parent folder to represent _the author's name_
- Every image should have its page number in parentheses at the end of the file name
- Or you can just paste this _"Naming rule"_ in the _Download_ tab of the extension:
  ```
  {page_title}/{user} ({user_id})/{title} ({id_num})/{title} ({p_num})
  ```
- Make sure to **turn off** the option _"Save the R-18(G) works in the designated folder"_
- **Turn off** the option _"Do not create a folder when there is only one crawl result"_
- In the _More_ tab select _"Show advanced settings"_ and check **all types** of works under _"Save the metadata of the work"_ option
- Also, I think it's better to _"Save the ugoira work as"_ **GIF**
