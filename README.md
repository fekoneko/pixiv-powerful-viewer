## Creating collection

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pixiv Powerful Viewer parses specific folder structure inside collections. Follow the steps below to configure [Powerful Pixiv Downloader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/powerful-pixiv-downloader/dkndmhgdcmjdmkdonmbgjpijejdcilfh) extension properly.

- Use the following _"Naming rule"_ in the _Download_ tab:
  ```
  {page_title}/{user} ({user_id})/{title} ({id_num})/{title} ({p_num})
  ```
- **Turn off** the option _"Save the R-18(G) works in the designated folder"_
- **Turn off** the option _"Do not create a folder when there is only one crawl result"_
- In the _More_ tab select _"Show advanced settings"_ and check **all types** of works under _"Save the metadata of the work"_ option
- Also, I think it's better to _"Save the ugoira work as"_ **GIF**

## Hotkeys
